    <p> My name is Nathan Shulkin; welcome to my first website! I am a Baltimore resident, born and raised. I enjoy playing drums, seeing live music, travelling, running and poetry.</p>

    <p>I am interested in coding for two reasons; first, there is an increased demand for coders/web designers and I like the creative aspect of creating something out of nothing. Second, I want to have a job that has the potential for remote work since playing music requires lots of travelling.</p>
